# Swift Español

## Introduction

Translate [The Swift Programming Language](https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language) to Spanish. I have done an initial translation of the book and I think we could fork it, and then send to Apple. They are open to third-party translations as stated on [Swift.org](https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language):

> Although the ePub of The Swift Programming Language above is provided in English, we encourage you to participate in translating this document to other languages. The best way to do so is to get involved with an existing translation project or start a new one where there’s a need.

> If you know of a quality translation project underway, please let us know on the swift-dev mailing list, and we’ll do our best to provide a link to that project from this page.

## Motivation

The main barrier of entry for Swift programming in Latin America has traditionally been:

- Macbook (too expensive)
- iPhone (too expensive)
- Official Documentation only in English

Swift for Linux is a solution for the first two issues. This would solve the third and make Swift more accessible in Latin America. Also it could be taught in Latin American universities if a translation was available, which is difficult currently since there is no Spanish documentation.

## Proposed solution

I have already translated a portion of [The Swift Programming Language](https://swift.org/documentation/#the-swift-programming-language) at:

https://github.com/colemancda/Swift-Espanol

And I purchased a domain and have it pointing to

https://www.swiftespanol.com

We would need volunteers to sign up and pledge to translate on an ongoing basis. We could also accept pledges for translating certain parts. This organization would fork the existing repo, and contributors would fork and submit PRs. Eventually we would commit [upstream](https://github.com/colemancda/Swift-Espanol) to be good chaps. 

## Impact

A translated Swift Guide, combined with [IBM Swift Sandbox](https://swiftlang.ng.bluemix.net/#/repl), and [Swift on Linux](https://swiftnightly.com) would lower the barrier of entry for native Spanish speakers and allow Swift to be taught in Spanish-speaking educational institutions.

## Alternatives considered

Force native Spanish speakers to learn English in order to get involved with Swift programming. We felt this was not acceptable.
